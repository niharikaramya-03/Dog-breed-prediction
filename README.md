# Dog Breed Prediction 

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and transfer learning techniques to classify dog breeds from images. It's designed as a deep learning portfolio project and demonstrates image classification using a real-world dataset.

---

# Project Highlights

- Image classification of **dog breeds** using **deep learning**
- Based on a pre-trained model (Transfer Learning)
- Uses data augmentation for improved generalization
- Includes visualization of model performance
- Built in Jupyter Notebook (`Dog_Breed_Prediction.ipynb`)

---

# Dataset

- **Source**: Kaggle - Dog Breed Identification
- **Classes**: 120 Dog Breeds
- **Size**: 20,000+ Images
- **Labels**: Each image is labeled with a dog breed

---

# Tools & Libraries

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, Pandas
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

# Model Architecture

- Transfer Learning with **[Specify Model Here: e.g., ResNet50]**
- Global Average Pooling
- Dense layers with dropout
- Final output layer with softmax activation for multi-class classification
